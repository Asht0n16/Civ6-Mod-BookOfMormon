# Civ6-Mod-BookOfMormon
Civilization VI mod that allows players to play as civilizations and leaders from the Book of Mormon!
These notes are mostly just ideas for now.

## Civilizations and Leaders

#### Nephites
The Promised Land. Having a strong religion will give production and yeild boosts in each city. If their religion is weak (Nephite religion isn't majority or faith output is low), they will lose the production bonuses and yeild boosts, but they will gain some bonuses towards amenities and gold. +50% production towards Holy Sites.
- Nephi - "I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded."
  - Nephi's strong leadership allows builders to be produced with 25% less production and gives them +2 build actions.
  - Nephi can build Boats of Curious Workmanship that can cross ocean tiles earlier.
  - Newly settled cities automatically start with the Nephite majority religion.

- Mosiah 
  - Last Nephite King. Culture and religion bonuses.

- Captain Moroni - "In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children."
  - All new cities that are founded receive a free ancient wall. Production costs for walls and encampments districts are reduced.

- Gadianton
  - Gadianton is unable to form a religion, thus losing any Nephite bonuses for a strong religion. 
  - Luxury goods provide extra gold and culture.
  - Extra gold for pillaging and defeating enemy units.

- Mormon
  - Historian General. Science bonuses and a unique unit?

#### Lamanites
Bonuses to population growth (like Kongo). Unit production and maintenance costs lowered. 
- Laman
  - Bonus to settler production???

- Amalickiah
  - Extra influence over city states. Units receive bonuses when attacking fortifications.

- King Lamoni
  - Adopts a religion (like Kongo). If religion is strong, receives the same bonuses the Nephites can receive.

#### Jaredites
???
- Jared
- Coriantumr
