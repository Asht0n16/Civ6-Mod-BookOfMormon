# Civ6-Mod-BookOfMormon
Civilization 6 mod that allows players to play as civilizations and leaders from the Book of Mormon!
These notes are mostly just ideas for now.

## Civilizations and Leaders

#### Nephites
The Promised Land. Having a strong religion will give production and yeild boosts. If their religion is weak, they will lose the production bonuses and yeild boosts, but they will gain some war related bonuses.
- Nephi - "I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded."
  - Nephi's strong leadership leads to enhanced production (like Germany).

- Mosiah 
  - Last Nephite King. Culture bonuses

- Captain Moroni - "In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children."
  - All new cities that are founded receive a free ancient wall. Production costs for walls and encampments districts are reduced.

- Gadianton
  - Gadianton is unable to form a religion, thus losing any Nephite bonuses for a strong religion. Luxury goods provide extra gold and culture.

- Mormon
  - Historian General. Science bonuses and a unique unit?

#### Lamanites
Bonuses to population growth (like Kongo). Unit production and maintenance costs lowered. 
- Laman
  - Bonus to settler production???

- Amalickiah
  - Extra influence over city states. Units receive bonuses when attacking fortifications.

- King Lamoni
  - Adopts a religion (like Kongo). If religion is strong, receives the same bonuses the Nephites can receive.

#### Jaredites
???
- Jared
- Coriantumr
